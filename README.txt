This is a team project written in c. It allows the user to construct a polynomial of the form ax^b. The following commands are defined within this program.

1)adc(coeffcient,exponent) - This function will add the given elemnt to the polynomial. Addition and substraction of elemnts with the same exponents will be handled here.
2)dex(exponent)-
This function will delete the elemnt with the given exponent if it exists in the polynomial.
3)der(first exponent, second exponent)- 
This function will delete any elements within the given two exponents, exponent 1 < exponent 2. 
4)prp()-
This function will print the current polynomial or it will print 0x^0.
5) pvp(value)-
This function will print the final value of the polynomial once the x is substitued with the  given value.
6)psc()-
This function will print the smaller coefficient
7)prd()- 
This function will print the value of the highest exponent or 0x^0 if there are no elements in the polynomial
8)prc(exponent)-
This function will print the coefficient of the given exponent if it exists in the polynomial
9)plc()-
This function will print the largest coefficient within the polynomial. 

There are multiple example input files are included along with some output files. For some reason there are an uneven number of them, so youll have to forgive me.
